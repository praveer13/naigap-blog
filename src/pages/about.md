Hi, I'm Praveer Naigaonkar. This blog acts as a journal for my side projects, learning journeys, and thoughts about what I'm currently obsessed with.

## What I'm Working On

I use this space as a thought organization tool to track the projects I start and document my journey through various interests.

### Current Projects

**Building zk-SNARK Libraries in Zig**

I'm currently working through building a toolset in Zig to create zk-SNARK libraries. This involves learning enough cryptography and Zig to make meaningful progress, and I'll be documenting my process throughout this journey.

**Health and Wellness as a Parent**

As a parent of two toddlers, I'm focused on improving my health through better eating habits and finding ways to workout as an extremely busy vegetarian parent. I'll share what works (and what doesn't) in balancing health goals with the demands of parenting.

**Playful Physics with Kids**

I'm working on getting my older kid (4 years old) interested in physics in a fun, playful way. This involves building projects and experiments that make science engaging and accessible for young minds.

## My Interests

My primary interests span across tech, programming, music, cooking, improving as a parent, and continuous health improvement. This blog reflects the intersection of these interests and serves as a record of my ongoing learning and growth.

## About This Site

This site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and serves as both a journal and a knowledge base for my projects and experiences.
